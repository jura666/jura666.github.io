a) I usually contact with others via phone which is effective most of the time for it is immediate communication. Problems can be solved there and then. But sometimes it can also be frustrating when the person you want to talk to is not available or you are not there when they ring back.
b) I usually contact with others via the Internet. There are lots of chatting tools we can use, such as QQ and MSN. They are economical for chatting and discussing questions. But both sides should be online. Email is also an effective way especially when files have to be sent.
c) I usually contact with others via short messages. In this way I have enough time to consider the phrasing, however the loss of the actual tone of the words may lead to misunderstanding.
