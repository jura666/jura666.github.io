Firstly, think about the possible situation and topics and organize your thought in advance. Secondly, speak loud. Loud and accurate speaking may increase your confidence. Also, it can give others a good impression of you. Thirdly, listen carefully. The ability to be a good listener is one of the requirements for a good communicator. Finally, seek other ways of expression when you meet problems. Make full use of your body language - drawing, mimicking, etc.
