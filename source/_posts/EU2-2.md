Yes, I had a misunderstanding with a foreigner when he wanted to buy a shirt from me. When he asked me the price of the shirt, I told him 50 yuan in Chinese. Unfortunately, he couldn't understand Chinese. Then I showed him my five fingers. He thought it was 5 yuan. I had to use the calculator to press the number 50 on it. Finally,  he understood and bought one for 50 yuan. From this experience I learned that non-verbal language, such as body language, gestures, even an eye contact, can help us communicate with others.
