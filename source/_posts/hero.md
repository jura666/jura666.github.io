A hero is anyone who can show courage when faced with a problem. A hero is a person who is able to help another in various ways.  A person can become a hero by saving someone who is in danger. When I was a child, I literally looked up to those tall people, like my parents, who are probably my first heros. And when I watch those heroic figures such as Superman or Ultraman, I wish I could have the same power as they do so that I could defeat those monsters and save people. Now, from my point of view, a hero is one who, in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage and the will for self-sacrifice for some greater good.

### from wikipedia
- A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity(逆境, 不幸, 灾祸, 灾难) through feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are Medieval and modern heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.
