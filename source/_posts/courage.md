[Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "马克•吐温") once said, courage is not the absence of fear. It is acting in spite of it. It could be the courage to speak the truth, the courage to speak our mind and not stay silent, the courage to stand up for what we believe in, the courage to follow public rules and laws and insist that other people follow them too, and the courage to resist those who take easy ways out.

### from wikipedia
- Courage (also called bravery or valour) is the choice and willingness to confront agony, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation(恐吓, 威胁). Physical courage is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, discouragement, or personal loss.
