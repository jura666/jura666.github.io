I think telling or not may not be a matter of ethics, but of personality and demeanor([di'mi:nә]行为，品行，举止). It depends on how we view the favor we have done for others. I think most people feel happy when they can help others. There are also some people who think they should be rewarded at least with the word "thanks". And by telling others, one can serve as good example for them.
